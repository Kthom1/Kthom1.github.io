    I worked at the internal tools department in Rakuten and used mostly <code>Ruby on Rails</code> and <code>Vue</code> to build applications to improve workplace efficiency.

    I was responsible for designing and implementing the frontend of a major project, and I also helped to develop and write tests for the Rails API.
